Natural Langauge Processing is an exciting field that allows computers to understand text by vectorizing. There are many modles out there that do this:
Bag of Words
Term Frequency
Term Frequency INverse Document Frequency (TFID)
Word2Vec
Topic Modeling (LSI, HDA, LDA)
FastText
WordRank

This Repo contains code that goes through each model (right now only TFIDF and Word2Vec are included) with 4 simple sentances:

'The cute kitten purred and watched the Stark girl.'

' After losing interest the cute furry cat purred and meowed.'

' Sly yet silent, the cute kitten meowed and she noticed.' 

' The loud furry dog ran and bit at air.'
